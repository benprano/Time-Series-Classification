# Time-Series-Classification

Time series prediction and classfication are the one of major problems in industrie such as Health service , Financial so on.
Deep Learning is known capable to do great job when extracting complex patterns from the data but this power comes with some problems such as interpretability of the decision taken by the network to do such prediction time series based on their caracteristics .
In this work we use CAM (Class activation map) to interpret the decision from the network
